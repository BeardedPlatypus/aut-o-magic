A collection of python scripts I use to automate boring or tedious
processes where possible. Currently the following scripts have been developed. 
Additional scripts will be added, when developed and tested:

* [blender](https://github.com/BeardedPlatypus/aut-o-magic/tree/master/blender): Script to automate exporting of 3D models to be laser cut.
* [blog](https://github.com/BeardedPlatypus/aut-o-magic/tree/master/blog): Script to compile and test my pelican blog
* [elm](https://github.com/BeardedPlatypus/aut-o-magic/tree/master/elm): Script to compile elm projects
* [sharepoint](https://github.com/BeardedPlatypus/aut-o-magic/tree/master/sharepoint): Script to sync Exchange Online contacts with a sharepoint List
