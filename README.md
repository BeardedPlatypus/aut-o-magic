A collection of python scripts I use to automate boring or tedious
processes where possible. Currently the following scripts have been developed. 
Additional scripts will be added, when developed and tested:

* [blender](): Script to automate exporting of 3D models to be laser cut.
* [blog](): Script to compile and test my pelican blog
* [elm](): Script to compile elm projects
* [sharepoint](): Script to sync Exchange Online contacts with a sharepoint List
